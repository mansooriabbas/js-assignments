
### The Sauna

This task involves an American entering a temperature for a sauna heater until they input a temperature considered suitable. To check this, we need a temperature indicating the minimum acceptable temperature and another indicating the maximum acceptable temperature.

Unfortunately, our dear sauna visitor only understands Fahrenheit, while the sauna heater only understands Celsius. Therefore, you have been asked to write a program that converts the input from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

The optimal temperature for the sauna is 75 degrees celsius, but the acceptable temperature range is from 73 to 77 degrees. This should be controlled entirely in a conditional statement within a loop.

If the temperature is below the minimum acceptable temperature, the program should indicate that it is too cold, and the visitor should turn up the heat a bit. After that, the sauna visitor can set a new value on the sauna heater, and the loop repeats until the temperature is within the acceptable range, and a final message to the American should be logged.
